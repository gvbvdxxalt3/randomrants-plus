Tried it, and the next 3 days, then hit the time limit. Asked ChatGPT for ideas, tried GoormIDE, that also has a time limit. First week forgot to stop the program, ran out of credits.

Recovered next month, only lets me work on it for 1 week before almost out of credits.'},{element:"p",textContent:"Asked ChatGPT for more ideas, got Stackblitz, finally one that doesn't limit runtime, the catch: \"Out of memory\".

It runs on Render now, but what doesn't it provide for free? Online IDE."},{element:"p",textContent:"And why can't I work locally: Grounded. And, I'm limited to use at school, on a school chromebook. And its locked to browser only for everything, no linux command terminal."},{element:"p",textContent:'I can write updates still, once GoormIDE adds credit counts after the first of every month.
