It was used a lot to get me talking to other Scratchers, just basically people on scratch, but eventually Scratch Moderation caught up and banned me. This site was the first few bans I recieved on scratch for. Later things improved, but then antoher site I made caused my scratch account to ban, then dissapear forever. A hacker somewhat inspired me to make admin commands (the hacker hacked in his own commands, then I added offical ones to the site) and quite scared me into making my future sites more locked down and secure. That hacker hopped in as "user123", completley unknown person, swearing and posting stuff not allowed on scratch, and leaking everyones IPs. It had a bug which allowed execution of code by typing in HTML, I always used innerHTML to insert text via code, but later I learned textContent is safer.',

This app was popular around my school, and also had sound triggers like [vineboom] which you can trigger in chat, but then people asked for more sounds, and then the real true soundboard was added.
