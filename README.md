### Temporary repostory notice

Lost the other github account, so have to wait until I get access to it again.
This _will_ be deleted and transfered to the original when I get it back, so don't try to use this as an permalink.

## What is Random Rants +?

Random Rants + is the next generation of Random Rants,
aimed towards having new functions and is more like an actual social media site.
Random Rants + also aims for the fun of the original Random Rants, so you don't get
as bored easily.

**_Glitch.com is no longer hosting projects (and that means our Random Rants + doesn't work on glitch anymore), because of that we switched to render.com to run Random Rants +._**

## Preparing Supabase enviroment variables

Create a Supabase project and provide the following enviroment vairales:

- sbBucket: Your Supabase storage bucket
- sbAPIKey: Your Supabase secret key or api key (I recommend secret key)
- sbURL: Your Supabase project url (Needs to be like `https://projectid.supabase.co`)

## Installation and building

**_Make sure you don't skip the Supabase project stuff, as it is required to run the server._**

I recommend using Node.JS 16.x, then either `git clone https://github.com/Random-Rants-Chat/randomrants-plus.git` onto your computer or download by zip.

In the directory of package.json, run `npm install`. After that, use `npm run build` to build the website, and use `npm run start` to start up the server.

For auto reload: Then instead of `npm run start`, use `npm run development`. Note this works for both building and server code.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the functional Random Rants + site in action.
